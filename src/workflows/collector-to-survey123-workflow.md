# Collector to Survey123 workflow

## Limitations

This workflow cannot be used with Cadasta Surveys, our white-labeled version of Survey123. Collector for ArcGIS does not allow to link outside of an ArcGIS product. The link starting with `cadastasurveys://` will not work the same way as a link starting with `arcgis-survey123://`). Hence, we won't be able to link to Cadasta Surveys to complete the form after the polygon is collected. The issue has been [confirmed with a ESRI representative](https://my.esri.com/#/support/cases/02229327).
