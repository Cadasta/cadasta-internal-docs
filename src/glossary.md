Terms defined in this document will appear as annotations when used within our documentation. 

## Markdown

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.

Markdown allows users to quickly write formatted text in a way that can be converted to HTML. [Read more about Gitbook's Markdown support...](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/syntax/markdown.html)

## Pull Request

<<<<<<< HEAD
> Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum. For more information, see "[About pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)." [_\[source\]_](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)

## Repository

> A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files \(including documentation\), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. [_\[source\]_](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository)

## WYSIWYG

> An acronym for "what you see is what you get". In computing, a WYSIWYG editor is a system in which content \(text and graphics\) can be edited in a form closely resembling its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product,\[2\] such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation.
