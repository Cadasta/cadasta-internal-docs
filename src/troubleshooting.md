# Troubleshooting

###### After I created a polygon on collector, Cadasta Surveys does not open

Collector for ArcGIS does not allow to link outside of an ArcGIS product; you can not open a link from Collector to Cadasta Surveys, our white-labeled version of Survey123. With the [Collector to Survey123 workflow](/workflows/collector-to-survey123-workflow.md), you need to use Survey123 and make sure the link provided in the polygon pop-up starts with `arcgis-survey123://`. The issue has been [confirmed with a ESRI representative](https://my.esri.com/#/support/cases/02229327).
