# Cadasta's Documentation System

Cadasta utilizes [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) to generate its online documentation. Note that this is no longer the same as using the [GitBook Version 2 service](https://gitbook.com), which (at time of writing) no longer supports multi-language books or exporting books to PDF.[<sup>[0]</sup>](https://docs.gitbook.com/v2-changes/important-differences)

Information about the inner-workings of Gitbook can be found in the [GitBook Toolchain Documentation](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/). Useful sections include:

- [Support for multiple languages](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/languages.html)
- [Generating eBooks and PDFs](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/ebook.html)
